# Detect-Retina-Damage-Using-Transfer-Learning
Transfer learning will be used to train a deep learning model on a small dataset of less than 1,000 retinal OCT images. This approach addresses the challenge of limited data availability in medical imaging, particularly for retinal optical coherence tomography scans, which are widely used but time-consuming to analyze.
