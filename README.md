# Detect-Retina-Damage-Using-Transfer-Learning

## Project Overview

Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique used to capture high-resolution cross-sections of the retinas of living patients. Approximately 30 million OCT scans are performed each year, and the analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time (Swanson and Fujimoto, 2017).

Due to the difficulty in obtaining large datasets of medical images, we aim to use transfer learning to train a deep learning model using only a small dataset consisting of less than 1,000 retinal OCT images.

## Requirements

- Learn Python language
- Use popular ML and DL frameworks such as:
  - SciKit-Learn
  - PyTorch
  - TensorFlow (backend engine)
- Implement Flask (web application framework) for the front-end interface
