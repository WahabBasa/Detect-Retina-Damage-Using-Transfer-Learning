# Detect-Retina-Damage-Using-Transfer-Learning
Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique used to capture high resolution cross sections of the retinas of living patients. Approximately 30 million OCT scans are performed each year, and the analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time (Swanson and Fujimoto, 2017). It is often difficult to obtain large datasets of medical images. We would like to use transfer learning to train a deep learning model using only a small dataset consisting of less than 1,000 retinal OCT images. Requirements:

• Learn Python language.
• Use popular ML and DL frameworks such as SikitLearn/PyTorch/TensorFlow (backend engine). 
• Flask (web application framework) for the front-end interface.
